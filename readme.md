Twitter Reach Calculator
========================

Given a twitter search query, calculates the a rough number representing the direct reach
  
Caveats:
  
1. Doesn't take into account the fact that a given user may follow two people that tweet a URL ( *e.g., just adds follower counts of all matching tweets* )
 
2. Doesn't take into acount RTs ( *e.g., if a tweet mentions the query parameter, and then is RT'd, the RT will not be counted* )
  
3. Limited to first 100 results ( no paging )
